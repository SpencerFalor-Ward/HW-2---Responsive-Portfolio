## Benefits of this project
**Practice Bootstrp** to familiarize how it can quicken the creation of a website and, more *importantly* make the website dynamic on multiple screen sizes :computer::iphone::tv::pager:

## Hurddles 
The dificulties about this project are as follows:
- Writing the code (who knew :gimacing:
  - As always, adding my own personal touch with out getting to *deep in the weeds*
  - **Positioning and sizing of elements** so my page doesn't look like a [Piet Mondrian](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Piet_Mondriaan%2C_1930_-_Mondrian_Composition_II_in_Red%2C_Blue%2C_and_Yellow.jpg/800px-Piet_Mondriaan%2C_1930_-_Mondrian_Composition_II_in_Red%2C_Blue%2C_and_Yellow.jpg)
